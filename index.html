              Early in the morning, on February 24, 2022, President Vladimir
              Putin delivered an address to the nation announcing the start of a
              special military operation in Donbas. In this appeal, the head of
              state refers to numerous requests for military assistance from the
              heads of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics. Vladimir
              Putin said that the purpose of what is happening, according to
              him, is to protect people who are being subjected to genocide, as
              well as his concerns about statements by the Ukrainian authorities
              about the possibility of returning nuclear weapons and moving NATO
              forces to Russian borders. After a couple of hours, messages about
              explosions in Kyiv, Kharkov, Odessa began to appear massively on
              social networks, Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities.
              Representatives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine
              claim that military command posts were subjected to missile
              attacks in Kyiv and Kharkov, and the mayor of Boryspil said that
              the explosions that were heard in the area of ​​the Kiev airport
              of the same name were air defense strikes on unidentified unmanned
              aerial vehicles Early in the morning, February 24, 2022, President

              authorities about the possibility of the return of nuclear weapons
              and the advancement of NATO forces to Russian borders. After a
